### Friction 1: References to other libraries within the Multipaz ecosystem are missing
- **Link**: [Installation](https://developer.multipaz.org/docs/getting-started/installation)
- **Impact**: Low â€” If someone wants to check it out other libraries needs to leave the documentation.
- **Proposed Fix**: Add the links for other Multipaz libraries

### Friction 2: Pending implementations
- **Link**: [Issuer](https://developer.multipaz.org/docs/getting-started/issuer)
- **Impact**: Medium â€” When the documentation states 'Not yet implemented due to rapid development...', it can create the perception that the whole documentation was rushed.
- **Proposed Fix**: Include a straightforward Work in Progress note accompanied by an icon (ðŸš§).

### Friction 3:TODO: References
- **Link**: [Issuer Trust](https://developer.multipaz.org/docs/getting-started/issuer](https://developer.multipaz.org/docs/getting-started/verifier/issuer-trust))
- **Impact**: High â€” Having link references for completed items creates an issue: users expecting to follow them will find no destination..
- **Proposed Fix**: Remove the todo and add the link if the link does not exist remove the text: "This was already handled in the holder/reader trust section (todo: link)".
